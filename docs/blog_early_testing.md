We are thrilled to open up **Proxle** for early testing! Every day brings a new puzzle, a new challenge, and a new opportunity to test your semantic wit against our AI.

## What is Proxle?

Proxle is a hybrid word-guessing game that combines the best of deductive spelling games with semantic discovery. It's not just about finding the right letters—it's about finding the right *meaning*.

## How to Play: The Basic Rules

Your goal is to guess the secret word (which can be **3 to 5 letters long**). You get two powerful types of feedback after every guess:

### 1. Spelling Hints (The Classics)
Just like you're used to, the tile colors tell you about the spelling:
*   **Green:** Right letter, right spot.
*   **Yellow:** Right letter, wrong spot.
*   **Gray:** Letter not in the word.

*Pro Tip: Green squares also reveal the length of the word!*

### 2. Meaning Hints (The Twist)
This is where Proxle shines. Every guess is analyzed by our AI to see how semantically similar it is to the target word.
*   **Context Score:** You'll see a percentage (0-100%).
    *   **100%:** Victory! You found the word.
    *   **High %:** You are "heating up"—the meaning is close (e.g., guessing "King" when the answer is "Queen").
    *   **Low %:** You are "cold"—try a different topic entirely.

## Coming Soon

We are just getting started. Here is what's in the pipeline for future updates:
*   **Login System:** Save your progress across devices.
*   **Streaks:** Track your daily victories and show off your consistency.
*   **More Stats:** Detailed breakdowns of your guess distribution and semantic accuracy.
