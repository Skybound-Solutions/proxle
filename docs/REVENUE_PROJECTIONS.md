## 🧠 Analysis: How to Beat the Odds

### 1. The "Whale" Effect 🐋
In donation models, **80% of revenue comes from 5% of donors**.
*   Most people give $0.
*   Some give $5.
*   **A few super-fans will give $50 or $100.**
*   **Crucial Strategy:** Ensure your leaderboard has a "VIP" or "Top Supporter" tier to recognize these people. If you cap recognition at $5, they won't donate $50.

### 2. Visibility is Liquidity 👁️
*   **Passive Button:** "Oh, I didn't see it."
*   **Leaderboard:** "Wow, Alice donated? I want to be on that list."
*   **Story Wall:** "Supporters get their stories featured? I want that visibility."

### 3. The "Tip Jar" vs. "Club Member" Psychology
*   **Tip Jar:** "Here's a dollar for your trouble." (One-time, low value)
*   **Club Member:** "I am a **Supporter** of Phrasle." (Recurring, identity-based)
*   *Note: Your "Supporter Tier" badges are excellent for this.*

## 🎯 Realistic Goal for Month 1

**Target:** Break Even ($30/month)
**Requirement:** 4-6 Supporters @ $5 each.
**Needed Traffic:** ~500 - 800 Daily Active Users (with your Community features).

## 💡 Recommendation
Don't rely on volume. Rely on **relationships**. The "Story Wall" and direct developer interaction (you approving names) creates a bond that passive games lack. That bond is what opens wallets.
